After a few years away from Toronto, spent working at some really cool companies, I've decided that it's time to move back to the city I love. All that's missing is a job I'd love, too.

I'm a product manager at heart. Back in 2013, I launched a startup so that I could get building product, and belatedly realized I'd also have to learn how to code if I was going to get anything out the door. It was an enormous challenge — not just a technical one, either — and the lessons I learned there defined how I handle product problems and product teams.

Most importantly, I learned how to rally people behind an ambitious vision so that they can make the product their own. Leading small teams over three years, we shipped 4 innovative apps, beginning with [Strings.fm](http://strings.fm). Plus, I learned all the lessons of The Mythical Man Month and Lean Startup firsthand.

Since then, I've been working as a very technical product marketer at Heroku, and later at Realm. That's been fun for a whole new set of reasons: the pace of launches, the agility of our work, and the chance to deeply impact the success of a product once it's been built.  I'm happy to have learned a new set of skills that helps me launch meaningfully good products, but it's time to get back to the work I love most.

I think I bring a lot as a product manager to the right company. My entrepreneurial background means I'm super effective in developing new directions, and my track record as a product marketer shows that I can keep the vision alive in established product lines. Hopefully, my new job will give me the responsibility to do both these things right.

I'm experienced with remote work, so no sweat if your org isn't Toronto-based. Here's [my resume](/assets/andrew-konoff-resume.pdf), and you can let me know if you've got a role for me [via e-mail](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf).
