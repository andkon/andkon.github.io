Turns out that split-flap displays, like this one from an East German train station, can only move on direction.

Every day that I push code to a repository on Github, it iterates one more destination. But every time I don't, it has to spin all the way back to the previous one. By missing a day of creative work, I'm only falling behind a little, but it never feels that way.
