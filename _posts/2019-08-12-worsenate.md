Sometimes, you face a big awful structural problem and just have to live with it for a while, because how are you supposed to do anything about it? Like the internet! It's really just a bunch of pipes of data, I think, but it turns out to have all these pernicious features that emerge only when you put enough people on it who want do all the things that people want to do. And then we're just supposed to be stuck with that, unable to change the structural shittiness of the Internet.

The internet is full of bad people, who want to do bad things, and misguided people, who do bad things but didn't mean to, and then there's all of us trapped in that picture with them, who end up just feeling bad.

Then, layer on the incentives of apps and platforms themselves, and you get a real bad scene: in order to get more money, they need to show more ads, and they can only show more ads if they have more people staying on their site for longer. That's how engagement gets prized beyond all other metrics, and how features and enhancements get prioritized, built, and evaluated based on how much they improve engagement.

Oops! Now you get stuff like the YouTube rabbit hole that, in a perverse re-imagining of the Wikipedia rabbit hole, always ends in philosophy, but shitty philosophy performed by charlatans who want your money. Or a Twitter that is saturated in outrage, exasperation, and the performance of harm, all because that's what plays well – both filling our brains with novelty and a little hit of excitement, and offering us the promise of feeling like we took action if we just retweet whatever it is that is so urgently being screamed by someone with like 200 followers and the #resistance hashtag in their bio.

And that's where my project began: I wanted to feel less engaged and a lot chiller on an internet full of apps that want my engagement at any cost.

Let's take Instagram for example. I began by enacting some retaliatory measures. First, I just deleted the app, but then realized I liked communicating by it. Then I set an iOS Screen Time limit set for 5 minutes; I usually blow through that in the first minutes I'm awake. Then I deleted the app again and discovered that Instagram has a barebones mobile web app! I couldn't DM, or watch Stories, and I could barely post anything. I had to open up Safari and literally type in "www.instagram.com" and then discover I'd been blocked from liking pictures for some reason. But it felt like how Instagram once felt to me: a minor distraction, not a constant threat.

It was so great. But, unfortunately, they improved it. Some smart product manager noticed that it didn't let you DM anyone, and you couldn't see Stories, and that you couldn't post stuff easily. Then they made it better, and more engaging. And we're back to square one.

So I thought: what if I just made Instagram shittier myself? Wouldn't it be nice if I had control over what I saw and how I used these apps?

# Worsenate: the app for a worse (but nicer) internet
It's the easiest, simplest app for the hardest, dumbest problem. Using the Safari Content Blocking engine on iOS, it securely and privately strips your apps of whatever you don't want to see anymore. Are you sick of DMs? Flip the switch, and they're gone. What about Stories? Or the Explore page? It's all there, and all removable – thanks to Worsenate. And just to reiterate, it's private: Apple's built the underlying API so that no matter what, I couldn't learn anything about what you're doing on those sites.

There's just one requirement: it only works on the mobile web versions of the apps. That means you probably have to delete your nice pristine Instagram app and login to Instagram on Safari to get the full effect. Of course, you don't have to, but Worsenate offers a helpful little reminder of how you've failed to make engagement as painful as possible:

It's also not just for Instagram! YouTube, Twitter and Facebook are both awful and sticky in their own special ways, and in need of shittifying. I incorporated many great options to deprive you of their temptations as well, including ??????????

It's available on the iOS App Store starting today, for free. To unlock the full bounty of options for the most online of us, it costs only $3.75 – a price I picked because that's how much my local coffee shop charges for a delicious cappuccino, sans tip. I've got the tip covered.
