*This year, I pledged to make some dang apps again, but unlike the apps that I did for my startup years ago, these would be things made in no one’s interest but my own\. Ones that would be unfundable, unfindable, and unremarkable except in how narrow their niche is\. Well, maybe there is one remarkable thing about them, taken separately and as a whole: how clearly that technology, deliberately made and applied, can allow me to connect with some important part of myself\.*

*This post is the first in a series. [You can read about the other apps here]().\.*

I have a problem with spending\. Like most things in my life, it fluctuates wildly as a counterforce to give me emotional stability\. Money can do many things: chiefly, it can add novelty and surprise and promise and hope\. It promises to transform with no other effort required than the spending of it\.

And that’s a big problem\. Part of the solution is just getting better at managing and maintaining a healthy emotional life, and noticing that my urges to spend are promptings to get back into touch with myself and my needs\.

But part of it is giving me a better option for how to plan my spending\. That’s where Ynab, and Ynabby, the companion app I made, fit\.
