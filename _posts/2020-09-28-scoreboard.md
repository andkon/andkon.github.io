# Creating vue app
Using the CLI, we'll use a built-in command for creating a Vue app with a build step. If you'd like to create a Vue app and deploy it to HubSpot without a build step, [check out the docs](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/guides/js-frameworks#vuejs).

```
hs create vue-app scoreboard
hs watch . scoreboard --initial-upload
```

Neato!
