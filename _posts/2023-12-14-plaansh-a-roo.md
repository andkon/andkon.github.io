I finished my first short film this year. It's about a kid – Jonny – who breaks his skateboard. He meets some guys who play his grandpa's old fiddle tunes, and he figures he might be able to busk to buy a new board. But is that what he really wants?

It's called Plaansh a Roo. Developed in the imagineNative + Netflix Shorts Lab, and funded by Canada Council for the Arts, the Indigenous Screen Office, and Ontario Arts Council, it's coming to a film festival near you.
