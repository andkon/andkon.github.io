I make art with code to talk about creative productivity. I use found pieces of technology (like wth Zwikau, a conceptual art piece built off an East German split-flap display), game and app dev, and unscalable hacks. In short, I use code in deeply unserious ways to make things that people won't find useful, merely to remind people of the dangers of thinking that coding is a serious pursuit.

I also write here, in long-ish form. I work in and around startups, and am currently a [consulting product marketer](http://grok.work). That means I help folks tell a story about what they've built, to people who should hear it and in a way that connects deeply with them.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf), look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
