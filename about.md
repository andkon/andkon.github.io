This is Andrew's _cool internet site_. I'm a musician who lives in Toronto and works at [LogDNA](https://logdna.com) as a product manager. I'm also a big fan of the internet, which is where you put _sites_ like this one. I'll be honest: it's a lot of work, and you have to write "code." I would not recommend it, though I remain a big fan.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/konoff), look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
