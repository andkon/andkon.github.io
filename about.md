This is Andrew's _cool internet site_. I'm a big fan of the internet, which is where you put _sites_ like this one. I'll be honest: it's a lot of work and you have to write "code." I would not recommend it, but I remain a big fan.

This website is also a _weblog_, which is a place on the internet where I write things. I have no idea why anyone would do this either, and struggle to find a good reason myself. Mostly, I made the website I think my 8-year-old self would have liked; if there's an editorial bent, it might be to his taste as well.

You can look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), see what I post on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/konoff), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
