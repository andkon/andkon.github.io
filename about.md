I'm a MÃ©tis-Ukrainian artist working as a singer-songwriter, writer, and app maker, among other things. I live in Toronto, and grew up in Regina on Treaty 4 territory. In the past, I was the first Saskatchewanderer, a Mongol Rally finisher, and a recipient of National Research Council funding for a number of failed startups. This is my _Cool Website_.

You can look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), see what I post on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/konoff), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
