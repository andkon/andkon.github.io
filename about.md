title: About Andrew Konoff

---

I've got a pretty simple mandate. I make art with code to challenge widely held beliefs about how technology forces us to communicate. I work with many media, but largely with apps, and always with the goal of helping us discover hope, humour, and our common humanity. Using the tools that tech creates, I seek to create an alternative to the world that tech envisions.

I also write here, in long-ish form. I work in and around startups, and am currently looking for work [as a product manager](/toronto-product-manager), either in Toronto or remotely. That means I help folks tell a story about what they've built, to people who should hear it and in a way that connects deeply with them.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf), look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
