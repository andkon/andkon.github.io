I'm a MÃ©tis-Ukrainian artist based in Toronto, originally from Regina on Treaty 4 territory. I'm a musician, screenwriter, and app-maker. Previously, I was the first Saskatchewanderer, a Mongol Rally finisher, and a recipient of National Research Council funding as a startup founder. When I'm not engaged in my own creative practice, I consult as a creative technologist to solve adoption and engagement problems for developer-facing companies and platforms.
 This is my _Cool Website_.
