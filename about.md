I use code and earnestness to make art. A lot of the time, it's to make jokes about how hard it is to make art. Sometimes, it's to show that what tech says is inevitable really isn't. And often, it's with a view to not build a better world, but help us see the one we really live in.

Here, I also write on a lot of topics, like philosophy, mental health, and the weird intersection of art and technology. Right now, I work as a product management fellow with Code for Canada, where I'm helping out data projects relevant to the City of Toronto's Vision Zero plan.
