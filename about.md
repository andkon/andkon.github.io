This is Andrew's _cool internet site_. I'm a big fan of the internet, which is where you put _sites_ like this one. I'll be honest: it's a lot of work and you have to write "code." I would not recommend it, but I remain a big fan.

This website is also a _weblog_, which is a place on the internet where I write things. I do so almost only when I feel like some personally meaningful discovery of mine is something important that other people should think about too. In short, I publish things here quite infrequently.

I live in Toronto and work at logdna as a product manager. I've been on pretty much every side of a product team now, including as a developer and a product marketer. I also make music, which I'll be sharing a lot of on here.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf), look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
