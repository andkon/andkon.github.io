I'm a Métis-Ukrainian artist based in Toronto. I grew up in Regina, on Treaty 4 territory, and my Métis side is from Fort St. John, in northern BC. I'm a writer and director, and a singer and songwriter. Currently, I'm in post-production on Plaansh a Roo, a short film developed in the imagineNative + Netflix Shorts Lab, and funded by Canada Council for the Arts.
