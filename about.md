I use code and earnestness to make art. A lot of the time, it's to make jokes about how hard it is to make art. Sometimes, it's to show that what tech says is inevitable really isn't. And often, it's with a view to not build a better world, but help us see the one we really live in.

I also write a lot, here.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf), look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
