Andrew Konoff fought to not write this bio. He worked hard to avoid telling meaningful stories, instead spending a decade working desk jobs in tech. Unfortunately, he was accepted into the imagineNative + Netflix Shorts Lab, where he developed his first short film, Plaansh a Roo – a coming of age story about a Métis skater kid. Now, he's an emerging filmmaker, screenwriter, singer-songwriter, and app-maker. Scary. A Métis-Ukrainian man from Treaty 4 who now calls Toronto home, he hopes his bio will serve as a cautionary tale for anyone tempted to pursue their own authentic path. This is is his _Cool Website_.
