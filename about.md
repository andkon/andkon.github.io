This is Andrew's _cool internet site_. I'm a big fan of the internet, which is where you put _sites_ like this one. I'll be honest: it's a lot of work and you have to write "code." I would advise against doing anything related to the internet, yet I remain a big fan.

I'm a musician, writer, and tech worker living in Toronto. In the past, I was the first Saskatchewanderer, a Mongol Rally finisher, and a recipient of National Research Council funding for my music startup, Strings.

You can look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), see what I post on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/konoff), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
