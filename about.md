I make conceptual art using tech's tools, to show that what tech makes with them is neither inevitable nor desirable.

I also write here, in long-ish form. I work in and around tech. I've been a startup founder, a product marketer, and am currently a developer.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf), look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
