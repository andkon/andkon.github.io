title: About Andrew Konoff

I've got a pretty simple mandate. I make art with code to show that technology can embody hope, humour, and common humanity. I use a variety of media, but I'm especially fond of dumb, unscaleable apps.

I also write here, in long-ish form. I work in and around startups, and am currently a [consulting product marketer](http://grok.work). That means I help folks tell a story about what they've built, to people who should hear it and in a way that connects deeply with them.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andknf), look at what I've made on [Github](https://github.com/andkon), or [email me](mailto:andrew.konoff@gmail.com).
